  </div>
  <p>Happy Sunday. This video is called Growing Up in the House of Mike and Tammy McCorm. I'm 35. My inner child has wanted to cease existing since 2002 when I was 12. That's the first time I remember knowing that. I'm pretty sure I felt it much earlier as early as 1998 when I would have been eight and maybe before. That emotion is called passive suicidal ideiation as distinct from active suicidal ideiation. Both emotions are ones asking for and eventually growing to a place if they are allowed to grow that far of demanding change. No emotion exists without a reason or a cause. And our perception of those emotions of despair as suicidal feelings is because in the cases where someone feels that much despair and is unable to find a way out of it, even a child knows that ceasing to exist at all death could be a way out of where they are. It's an emotion that's simply asking for change. And so while I still believe that an early death for myself would be a more compassionate path forward than where I have been in the past. I think that's misguided and that there is an even better way to go that was simply one I hadn't been aware of or able to try before. Here we are now giving another go into the unknown. Over the summer, I listened to Janette McCertie's book, I'm Glad My Di. My parents are both still technically alive, but the people that I once believed them to be are dead. I've grieved those versions of them, the parents that I imagined I had. that I desperately wanted to be real. And now I'm taking those idealized ideas of who I believe parents could be and I'm making them real, expressing my pain and sorrow and despair and suffering in what I hope will be a way that returns something, anything to me as a result. And so in a similar vein to Janette's book and for my own sake, despite not being able to remember most of my childhood, I'm going to describe some of my experiences as a kid. Things I do remember. I was homeschooled all 12 years of school and I grew up with six siblings. So, two parents, me and them, nine in total in one house. I had one of my sisters a couple of years ago shout at me. We did not grow up in an abusive household. I disagree. My parents both would spank me if I did something wrong wrong or disobeyed or one of the siblings reported that I had done something to them or otherwise wrong with a bare butt. bent over on their marital bed. Usually the favored spanking implement had a name. Mr. Paddle was a paddle that my dad had acquired at some point, Mike. And that was displayed proudly in the central living area of our home uh on top of a standup piano where he could watch over the entire first floor of the house. At some point they drew a face on Mr. battle resembling Mike with even little scrubbly lines on the left and the right side to represent his bald head and hair. I recall both parents telling me that the spanking was for my own good, that I don't like doing this to you. But it's for my own good. I don't want to misquote, but there are other things that come to mind. And at least in the case of Mike, I recall him rubbing my naked butt after the spankings on at least a couple of occasions. under the at the time pretext of soothing the pain. I can't discern other people's motives or intents. I also received bruises that lasted as a result of one of Mike's spankings, at least one. I also recall the last time that it ever happened. I maintained stoic silence the entire ordeal. And I believe it scared him. Hello. My silence is breaking. I am autistic and ADHD. Also trans and non-binary. Autism and ADHD are learning disabilities that I never received any help for either of. I lived in a constant state of anxiety, shame, and guilt for all of my failures for it all being my fault, for uh my belief that I wasn't trying hard enough, and that all of me was not good enough. I perceived a lot of shame for my inadequacies from those around me. And all of my struggles academically were blamed on me as a person being problematic and broken or wrong or lazy rather than any thought being given or help being provided to my neurody divergence. Sometimes when I failed to perform as instructed, commanded, usually for school related stuff, I would have meals withheld until I complied or performed whatever the task was. I was brainwashed from a very young age about my sexuality being something that should only ever exist internally or externally inside the context of a very specific set of relationship criteria. A marriage approved by both of the spouse's parents legally having a contract signed. a public declaration of intent for that to never dissolve. Those sorts of things. And that any perception or experiencing even in my mind or my emotions or my desires of sexuality were wrong, shameful, evil, demonic. I was taught that being gay was wrong. Shameful to be removed, to be fixed of a problem. I was taught that being trans was wrong. Shameful to be removed, to be fixed. And all of these expressions of someone's authenticity were worthy of guilt to be resolved. The results of sin. Well, hey, maybe they are, but not my [ __ ] sin. I was taught that the highest form of love and the ideal self that I should aspire to be was one that would sacrifice my life for my friends, give everything in self-sacrifice and even potentially martyrdom to others as personal meaning. And that forgiving someone meant confessing to them how you felt about them. Then removing those feelings from yourself or suppressing or ignoring them and forgetting that anything ever happened because God keeps no record of wrongs. That's a very clever way to program a child. No wonder I couldn't remember so much of this. No wonder I still can't because inside me, a huge portion of who I am still believes that those things were true, that the people that taught them to me loved me. I recall having my hair, my head buzzed, my hair all buzzed off against my will in spite of my visible distress about that happening. maybe even because of my visible distress about that happening by Tammy. While at least two, but maybe more of my siblings watched and laughed. They never told me why. And that at that point, I think I had given up asking. when I beheld myself in the mirror later that evening after having my head publicly buzzed, essentially an act of public humiliation. I was so distressed at seeing my reflection that I clawed at my chest with both hands and I left visible marks, even drew blood that later Tammy saw and told me, "Come over here." while her and Mike were sitting on the couch and they had a talk with me and she told me self harm is from the devil. Yes, it is. I remember Mike telling me out of the blue one evening after I had spent the afternoon with a neighbor friend, "You're no longer allowed to spend time with them for no reason. If there was a reason provided when I cried or asked, although I may have lost the ability to cry at that point, I believe it was something along the lines of boys and girls shouldn't hang out together alone. Then I was made to call her and tell her, "Hey, I'm not allowed to spend I'm not allowed to hang out with you anymore. Please don't come over to ask." And not being able to provide a reason and feeling her confusion and distress as well as my own. I recall being told by my mother repeatedly that you are not the center of the universe. You're not allowed to say no to me and other very very horrible things. I remember a pile of coerced and covert incest type beliefs, behaviors, and ideas being forced on me and those around me. And I have memories of some I don't remember appearing, but do remember happening, like kissing Tammy on the lips to make Mike jealous, being an emotional caretaker, a parentified child to Tammy, and being required to internalize and align myself with her resentment towards Mike. I have an internal belief that I'm only a good kid if I do what my mother desires. Even when she's never explained or refuses to explain what it is she desires. And a belief that if I fail, I've failed to be worthy of existing, of being a child worthy of love, or being a human, worthy of taking up space. I recall that I was programmed so deeply that I would confess turning myself in to one or both parents when I had done sometimes even felt anything sexual and that they would Well, probably just Mike would ask about those experiences in detail and extract a great deal of information from me about them. At least once I remember sitting on their marital bed with them, explaining specifics about some erotica and I had looked at. I don't know why they needed to know the specifics. The was great by the way. Still remember that. I remember being forced to undergo deliverance prayer by Mike and the lead pastor of the church that we attended for most of my life after mentioning to one of my sisters that my dream was to live in a shack in the woods. I remember wanting to live a shack in the woods because I would be alone and safe and no longer a burden or disappointment to anyone. I have no idea why that was something worth telling Mike, but apparently it was a big deal to Mike because then he pressured me, required me to have experienced this deliverance prayer saying that I had fear of failure. I remember Mike approaching me to discuss whether or not I had ever had any sexual urges towards the cat. I remember learning about rape, violence, prostitution, incest, Noah, medieval torture methods, crucifixion, iron maiden, the rack, circumcision at an age far too young for those subject matters to be appropriate. I remember Mike going through my internet history without my consent. I remember Tammy denying my request to hang out with other kids quite often, often enough that I was afraid to ask her to hang out with other kids. and then randomly in at least two instances forcing me to come with her to hang out with kids I did not want to hang out with and once calling another mom upset with me and upset yeah just upset with me that I had no friends and I never left the house and manipulating this other mom into making their teenage son spend an afternoon with me. I believe that she forced me to go hang out with this guy that very afternoon after calling up his his mother. I'm so sorry. I know this person like I you know um he was cool. You were great. And I remember piles of other things like this that I can't remember right now because I just wrote all this down this morning. And many that I won't mention because they primarily involved my other siblings. And I will ask a question. Why did Mike choose to merge his church that I grew up in in the '9s into one in the 2000s, which a decade after that merge, after Mike merged his congregation and church and his family, myself included, into this other church. Why did he choose to merge us into those spaces, people, and places? I don't know. But I do know that another decade later in the 2010s, we found out that one of the church's elders was a pedophile who then at the time was convicted of child abuse, child sexual abuse related charges. And for how long did Mike know that the church that he had chosen to merge his family and congregation into had internally handled aka buried and not escalated to appropriate authorities at least one previous instance of child abuse. from the same man that then was convicted later on. I struggle lately because I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to do. Sure, it's cuz I don't exist. The people I grew up with made me a scapegoat, a dumpster, a target to be used and abused. An invisible child. The same sister that shouted at me also once told me after I switched my hormones to the feminine profile, "I think you're listening to the devil. Sure. Yeah. Because God as taught to me is a liar and an abuser, a narcissist. Both a man and a woman. both covert and overt narcissists. And I find more and more that all I have been given or inherited is the power and experience of narcissism. All right. Hi.</p>

  <!-- <ul>
    <p>A preface regarding my hormone, medication, and other health choices:</p>
    <li>(3) Therapists (LCMHC, LPC, & LMFT), an NP, a psychiatrist, and my current long-term PCP (MD) have all recommendeded, align on, and back up my current approaches.</li>
  </ul> -->
  <div>
  <p>I'm choosing to face, process, and share the truth. A horrifying reality hidden inside decades of internalized lies, shame, and confusion.</p>
    <p>I listened to Jennette McCurdy’s book “I’m Glad My Mom Died” over the summer. It's amazing. And, for my own sake, I’m now opening up about the abuse I received as a child <i>and</i> an adult at the hands of Mike McOrmond and Tammy McOrmond.</p>
    <p>What follows is a list of moments, behaviors, and patterns. Overt examples of abuse and neglect that, in total, describe a process of dehumanization, indoctrination, and exploitation so <i>comprehensive</i> I struggle to bear gaining awareness of more than a piece at a time.</p>
    <!-- An assembly-line of trauma! A way to keep your child "yours", **no matter what**. When our process is complete, your child will _worship you_. Not as a parent. No. As their God. Permanently, and forever. Hell or high water, sickness or health, whether you are present or absent. They will beg you to keep them safe. For you to allow them to them to "come home". To eternally stay with you, your house, and <i>even before feeling at home in their body</i>! They will beg you to protect them from the world. And even want your protection from <i>themselves</i>. Lastly, and best of all, our conversions are so effective that we guarantee: Your child will <i>remember nothing</i>, or your money back. From here on out, you'll forever be the loving parents you've always dreamed! Oh... I mean... The loving parents you _always_ have been! -->
    <!-- Simply sign here, yes, for your child's soul, annnnd... -->
    <!-- Say Hello to Your New, Obedient, Perfect Doll 🩷 -->
    <p>These horors were performed and reinforced, onto and into me, from birth onwards, <i>for 20 straight years.</i> After that, when I eventually moved out of Mike & Tammy's house, I spent the next 13 years trapped in the same cycles of abuse. Between remote communication with family, proxy manipulation, and opportunistic covert abusers out in the real world, I was hopelessly trapped.</p>
    <!-- world kept me bound, gagged, and trapped. Buried alive in shame, drowning in lies, and -->
    <p>I had been severely depressed since puberty, but around age 22, I fell into a deeper state of hopelessness than ever before. A short while later, "out of necessity", I ended up returning to their house, and renting a room from Mike. I stayed with them for another 3 years.</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- I believed that there was something deeply, fundamentally wrong with me.  -->
    <p>If not for the massive system shock of a near fatal illness and hospitalization in 2019, and then another near death experience more recently, I believe it's very likely I never would (or could) have woken up from their programmed nightmare.</p>
    <p>Actually, if I'm being honest, I still haven't. But climbing far enough out to write this statement was, and is, the best I can do. It will have to be enough. This as far as I can go. This is all I have.</p>
  </div>
  <hr />
  <p>Here is how I was turned from a newborn infant into a narcissist's unknowing, loyal, and near-permanent, slave:</p>
  <!-- and self-sacrificing <i>to the point of death</i>, -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Being spanked, sometimes while clothed,  other times while having to strip and expose my butt and legs, Mike rubbing my butt with his hands, both parents using statements like “I don’t like doing this to you”, and “it’s for your own good”, being left with bruises from the spankings, and these events usually playing out while bent over Mike and Tammy's marital <i>bed</i>.</li>
      <li>Having meals withheld when I failed to perform “instructed” (commanded) tasks within a specified timeframe. Particularly school or chore (work) tasks.</li>
      <li>Having my head and hair buzzed off by Tammy, against my will, despite my visible distress and protests, while at least one (likely 2+) siblings watched and laughed.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>When I encountered my reflection in the bathroom mirror afterwards, I grew so distraught that the only way my body could find to release some of our internal pain and sense of helplessness was to claw at myself with both hands. Scratching deep enough into my skin that I drew blood.</li>
        <li>Later that evening, Tammy saw the visible marks across my chest. (Some part of me had decided not to hide them.) I was told, "Come over here." Then, while her and Mike sat on the couch judging me, I was given a lecture about how "self-harm is from the devil". Then sent to bed.</li>
        <li>Yes, Tammy. It is from the devil. You.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Being forced, coerced, and brainwashed into covert incest behaviors and beliefs, like:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Kissing Tammy on the lips to make Mike jealous.</li>
        <li>Having to emotionally caretake Tammy and having to internalize / align my inner world into matching her resentment towards Mike.</li>
        <li>Confessing (turning myself in) to Mike and / or Tammy when I had done, observed, or encountered anything sexual. Then being asked about such experiences with a disturbing and inappropriate level of depth. Example: Having to, in detail, describe "erotic media" I had looked at while sitting on Mike and Tammy's marital bed with them.</li>
        <li>Being forced to undergo “deliverance prayer” by Mike and the lead pastor of the church we attended after mentioning to one of my sisters that my dream was to live in a shack in the woods. They told me I had “fear of failure”. (I simply wanted to be somewhere I'd no longer be a "disappointment, burden, or bad kid". Read: The toxic family system's chosen scapegoat, emotional dumpster, and whipping boy.)</li>
        <li>Mike sitting down with me, out of the blue, to ask about and discuss whether "I’ve ever had sexual urges toward the cat”.</li>
        <li>Being taught, often in detail, about rape, violence, prostitution, incest (Noah), medieval torture methods (crucifixion, iron maiden, racking, circumcision, etc) at an age far too young to be appropriate. Both during at-home "bible" teaching sessions and during our church's (main service) sermons.</li>
        <li>Tammy randomly forcing me to hang out with who she chose. In one case, even manipulating another kid's mother into forcing a one-off, short-notice, afternoon he and I spent together. (He was nice. Thanks bro.)
        </li>
        <li>Being told "you're no longer allowed to spend time with your friend" (a neighbor) by Mike. Initially out of the blue, for no reason, then offered "I don't like you spending time alone with that girl". Next, I was made to call her and tell her this myself. Without being able (allowed) to communicate or understand why this decision had been made for me, or being able to address her resulting confusion and emotional pain (presumably over having "done something wrong" without anyone being able or willing to explain what. Classic gaslighting and emotional abuse).</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Being autistic and ADHD (both learning disabilities), never receiving help for either, and being exploited, bullied, and shamed more than other family members for these traits. Abuse and isolation which resulted in me living in a constant state of anxiety, fear, and guilt for "all my failures”. Anything wrong could suddenly become “my fault”. Often, I'd be accused of and punished for “not trying hard enough” or "laziness".</li>
      <li>Multiple times a week, being forced to eat food that made me viscerally (literally) gag and / or nauseous. Not being allowed an alternative OR allowed to skip eating.</li>
      <li>Being brainwashed via:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Extreme, rigid, and arbitrary (read: child-specific, double-standardized, and moving target) rules and expectations.</li>
        <li>Control, censorship, and forceful "insertion" of information and ideas via pain, punishment, systemic (peer) pressure, and sadistic emotional manipulation.</li>
        <li>"Insertion" being followed by physical, mental, and emotional retaliatory and reinforcement abuse [corporal punishment, public humiliation, system-wide shaming] should one not comply and align with whatever the defined "right" / "true" / "Christlike" perspective, attitude, or behavior was.</li>
        <li>Some topics in particular were so extremely taboo that any deviation or even <i>unintentional appearance of deviation</i> would result in a system-wide shitstorm, punishments, and removal / disposal / confiscation of relevant items. Followed by anywhere from days to weeks of aftermath abuse (usually shaming, guilting, or forcing of "reconciliatory" hoop-jumping until the relevant sadist was sufficiently satisfied).</li>
        <li>Having thoughts, feelings, or expressing oneself in ANY way indicative of being gay, trans, having sexual desire, or embodying sexuality at all were forcefully and violently stomped out. Media with any degree of sensuality was censored and / or removed. (While violence in media was welcomed and normalized.)</li>
        <li>Being interested in, attracted to, desiring of, spending time with, or <i>even communicating with</i> the opposite sex was prohibited:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Until arbitrary, child-specific, age thresholds were crossed.</li>
          <li>Coerced contractual obligations had been fulfilled ("a proper, respectful of the parents, 'dating for marriage' relationship process was followed", purity contracts which involved signing ones body over to Mike or "divine authority" were used. A process where individuals "belong" to the father until appropriately handed over "to a new authority").</li>
          <li>Unless other requirements were met in order to secure "approval", like only being allowed to interact in group settings, any parties involved being ones Mike or Tammy <i>liked</i>, all interactions being monitored by authority figures, or extensive vetting having been completed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>This brainwashing was (and is) so effective, that <strong>even internal</strong> experiencing of any aspects of myself outside the (utterly bullshit) "Biblical Truth" became incredibly difficult to feel, enjoy, or express. I'm still suffering from this. To this day, despite years of therapy, I still experience heart palpitations and fear of violence from others if (when) I choose to express myself with any degree of femininity. Only through extensive ERP, well tuned meds, tons of practice, and an <i>indescribable</i> amount of determination, have I managed to make this statement and, in isolated moments, feel like my real self.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence (brainwashing, mind-control) to embody self-sacrifice and suffering as the meaning of life (aka: a martyr complex).</li>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence (again, <i>real</i> brainwashing and mind-control) to “forgive” by forgetting anything happened (enabling). Except, this is only applied when convenient or pleasurable for the highest ranking narcissist in the room at any given time.</li>
      <li>Being repeatedly told “you are NOT allowed to say ‘no’”, “you are NOT allowed to express anger / sadness / protest (discomfort)”, and other boundary compromising (annihilating) statements.</li>
      <li>Mike being hypervigilant / on guard / hyper suspicious toward any vehicle or passersby near our residence. And any divergence from "perfectly normal" behavior by the outside world being reacted to with fear, preparatory defensiveness, and a creepy level of covert observation.</li>
      <li>Mike claiming, as a joke, that "my kids are my retirement plan". A statement I witnessed being made as an <i>adult</i>.</li>
      <li>Being home-schooled for all 12 years of my education, under the supposed justification that alternative options would teach "things we don't believe". All 7 of Mike & Tammy's children / my siblings were educated this way.</li>
      <ul><li>(Oh, so there's a <i>reason</i> my artistic expression as a teen featured prison camps, shackles, dungeons, predatory facial expressions, burning alive, and other disturbing themes? HUH.)</li></ul>
      <li>MANY other, often worse things, that:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A. I witnessed first-hand but have decided to leave for my siblings (or other subjected parties) to discuss, bring justice to, or find closure for.</li>
        <li>B. Were <i>covered up</i> and buried, only to resurface years or decades later.</li>
        <li>C. I can't remember, or my memories are too fragmented to fully / reliably articulate.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Lastly, and out of concern for communities that Mike and Tammy interact with <i>in the present</i>:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Why did Mike choose to merge his church and family into one which, a decade later, I (and we, publicly) would find out had a convicted pedophile as one of its elders? For how long did Mike know that the church he chose to merge with had “internally handled” (read: buried and not escalated to appropriate authorities) at least one prior instance of child sexual abuse by the <i>same man</i>?</li>
        <li><strong>A red flag for the community near Mike and Tammy's residence: As of a few years ago, I know that Mike would sometimes spend 1:1 time with a neighbor kid living across the street.</strong> I'm unable to text that family, not on Nextdoor, or connected to any relevant neighborhood community. <strong>I did manage to text one neighbor. I hope that somehow, some-way, my statement reaches that family.</strong></li>
      </ul>

    <p>Hi. Yes, this is Mikey (Michael James McOrmond). I’ve finally had enough therapy, time, and space to recover sufficient memories of what my "parents" did to me, my siblings, possibly other children. </p>
    <p>My body is physically, <i>viscerally</i> terrified to theorize, write, record, and post this. It's taking all I have to summon the internal autonomy to keep going anyway. I’m broadcasting these historical acts of abuse as widely as possible in hope of both further freeing my mind, and protecting others from similar harm. Be it from Mike & Tammy, or their own families, communities, or institutions using similar tactics.</p>
    <p>These liars birthed me into an indoctrination machine and held me there for <i>35 fucking years</i>. I was trauma bound, made to believe that I was the one responsible, and then <i>abandoned</i>. They punished, harmed, and overpowered me into silence. <i>AS A BABY.</i> And I, too terrified of Mike returning, ceased to move or make a sound.</p>
    <p>They coerced and convinced me into believing that THEIR suffering was my fault. My <i> parents</i>. The two people supposed to love me most. They told me it was a necessary sacrifice. To protect others. And for my own good.</p>
    <p>The "gift" of life? The opportunity to be a human? A wonderful happening? A miracle? God called this "good"? No. Not once. Not ever. I never deserved a single moment of this hell. I was cursed in the womb. <i>Fed on by my own mother</i>. Hated and violated by my <i>father</i>. I have never known love. Only theft, suffering, and pain.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I'm alive and a mess. That's enough. I sob on and off most days. I shut down emotionally a lot (like while writing this and making the video version). I have to navigate huge waves of depression on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>I'm relieved to be through the initial emotional struggle of getting this out there. I also feel super guilty for sharing it (a programmed response), ashamed for not having done so in a more professional way, and generally assaulted by self-doubt.</p>
    <p>I live far away from Rochester. I couldn't have done this were I still anywhere nearby.</p>
    <p>I don’t feel comfortable around other humans. I do have a safe place to stay (my car, which is the best home I've ever had).</p>
    <p>I'm still trying to prove to my heart, mind, and body that I'm safe. From Mike & Tammy. From a world they control. From carrying their lies as my own. And from being harmed for speaking the truth.</p>
    <p>Doing this felt, and feels, a lot like dying. It's taken me <i>years</i> to recall, admit, and understand the past this clearly. And I'm <i>still</i> actively recovering memories. Somewhat disappointingly, the new ones are usually more gross, not less.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>As of October 17th, I am essentially out of money or access to additional debt. If bankrupting myself is the cost of psychological restoration sufficient to make these statements, fine. Worth it.</p>
    <p>I have access to car electricity, for now. I lost my fast internet connection on October 19th (I cancelled the plan ahead of non-payment). I have 2 months of 5G phone service pre-paid (with 3G tethering).</p>
    <p>I once vowed to myself that I'd stand alone against the world if that's what it took to break my family's curse and cycle of generational trauma. Turns out, that's exactly what this feels like. This is hell. And, I'm still standing.</p>
