    <ul>
      <li>I'm choosing to face, process, and share the truth. A horrifying reality hidden inside decades of internalized lies, shame, and confusion.</li>
      <li>I listened to Jeanette McCurdy’s book “I’m Glad My Mom Died” over the summer. (It's amazing.) Now, for my own sake, I’m going to describe some of my experiences as a kid:</li>
      <li>Having meals withheld when I failed to perform “instructed” (commanded) tasks within a specified timeframe. Particularly school or chore (work) tasks.</li>
      <li>Having my head and hair buzzed off by Tammy, against my will, despite my visible distress and protests, while at least one (likely 2+) siblings watched and laughed.</li>
      <li>Being spanked, on my bare butt, Mike rubbing my butt, statements like “I don’t like doing this to you”, and “it’s for your own good”, being left bruised afterwards, and these events usually happening while bent over Mike and Tammy's marital bed.</li>
      <li>Being coerced into covert incest behaviors and beliefs, like:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Kissing Tammy on the lips to make Mike jealous.</li>
        <li>Having to emotionally caretake Tammy and having to internalize / align my inner world into matching her resentment towards Mike.</li>
        <li>Confessing (turning myself in) to Mike and / or Tammy when I had done, observed, or encountered anything sexual. Then being asked about such experiences with a disturbing and inappropriate level of depth. Example: Having to, in detail, describe "erotic media" I had looked at while sitting on Mike and Tammy's marital bed with them.</li>
        <li>Being forced to undergo “deliverance prayer” by Mike and the lead pastor of the church we attended after mentioning to one of my sisters that my dream was to live in a shack in the woods. They told me I had “fear of failure”. (I simply wanted to be somewhere I'd no longer be a "disappointment, burden, or bad kid". Read: The toxic family system's chosen scapegoat, emotional dumpster, and whipping boy.)</li>
        <li>Mike sitting down with me, out of the blue, to ask about and discuss whether "I’ve ever had sexual urges toward the cat”.</li>
        <li>Being taught, often in detail, about rape, violence, prostitution, incest (Noah), medieval torture methods (crucifixion, iron maiden, racking, circumcision, etc) at an age far too young to be appropriate. Both during at-home "bible" teaching sessions and during our church's (main service) sermons.</li>
        <li>Tammy randomly forcing me to hang out with who she chose. In one case, even manipulating another kid's mother into forcing a one-off, short-notice, afternoon he and I spent together. (He was nice. Thanks bro.)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Being told "you're no longer allowed to spend time with your friend" (a neighbor) by Mike. Initially for no reason, totally out of the blue, then offered "I don't like that you spend time alone together with that girl". Then, being made to call her and tell her this myself without being able (allowed) to communicate or understand why this decision had been made for me.</li>
      <li>Being autistic and ADHD (both learning disabilities), never receiving help for either, and being exploited, bullied, and shamed more than other family members for these traits. Abuse and isolation which resulted in me living in a constant state of anxiety, fear, and guilt for "all my failures”. Everything wrong became “my fault” and, very often, the result of “not trying hard enough” or "laziness".</li>
      <li>Multiple times a week, being forced to eat food that made me viscerally (literally) gag and / or nauseous. Not being allowed an alternative OR allowed to skip eating.</li>
      <li>Being brainwashed via: control / exclusion of information, forceful "teaching" of ideas, and physical, mental, and emotional retaliatory abuse [corporal punishment, public humiliation, coercion] should we not immediately comply with the defined "right" / "true" / "Christlike" perspective. Some topics in particular were extremely taboo and any violations would result in a family-system-wide shitstorm, punishment, and after-abuse. Being gay, trans, or expressing one's sexual desires or sexuality were forcefully, violently suppressed, hated, shamed, censored, or otherwise feared. The brainwashing was (and is) so effective, that <strong>even internal</strong> experiencing of "bad" aspects of myself became physically impossible to feel, enjoy, or express. To this day, and despite years of therapy, I still experience heart palpitations and fear of violence if I choose to express myself with ANY degree of femininity.</li>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence to embody self-sacrifice and suffering as the meaning of life (a martyr complex).</li>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence to “forgive” by forgetting anything happened (enabling). Only applied when convenient or pleasurable, however, for the highest ranking narcissist in the room at any given time.</li>
      <li>Being repeatedly told “you are NOT allowed to say ‘no’”, “you are NOT allowed to express anger / sadness / protest (discomfort)”, and other boundary compromising (annihilating) statements.</li>
      <li>Mike being hypervigilant / on guard / hyper suspicious toward any vehicle or passersby near our residence. And any divergence from "perfectly normal" behavior by the outside world being reacted to with fear, preparatory defensiveness, and a creepy level of observation.</li>
      <li>Hearing Mike claim that "my kids are my retirement plan", disguised as a joke. A statement I heard as an <i>adult</i>.</li>
      <li>Being home-schooled for all 12 years of my education, under the supposed justification that alternative options would teach "things we don't believe". All 7 of Mike & Tammy's children / my siblings were educated this way. (Oh, so there's a <i>reason</i> my artistic expression as a teen featured prison camps, shackles, dungeons, predatory facial expressions, burning alive, and other disturbing themes? HUH.)</li>
      <li>MANY other, often worse things, that:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A. I witnessed first-hand but have decided to leave for my siblings to discuss, bring justice to, or find closure regarding.</li>
        <li>B. Were <i>covered up</i> and buried, only to resurface later.</li>
        <li>C. I can't remember, or have too fragmented memories of, to fully / reliably articulate.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lastly, out of present concern for communities Mike and Tammy interact with TODAY:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Why did Mike choose to merge his church and family into one which, a decade later, I (and we, publicly) would find out had a convicted pedophile as one of its elders? For how long did Mike know that the church he chose to merge with had “internally handled” (read: buried and not escalated to appropriate authorities) at least one previous instance of child sexual abuse by the same man?</li>
        <li>Now that I'm through the emotional struggle of initially ripping this band-aid off (which I largely anesthetized myself through), I want to wave a red flag for the community near their residence. As of a few years ago, I know that Mike would sometimes spend 1:1 time with a neighbor kid living across the street. I'm unable to text that family, not on Nextdoor app, or connected to any relevant neighborhood community. I did manage to text one neighbor. I'd hope somehow, some-way, that my statement reaches that family.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <p>Hi. Yes, this is Mikey (Michael James McOrmond). I’ve finally had enough therapy, time, and space to recover sufficient memories of what my "parents" did to me, my siblings, possibly other children. As well as sufficient internal autonomy to push through my body's physical terror at theorizing, writing, recording, and posting this online. I’m broadcasting the historical acts of abuse as widely as possible in hope of both further freeing my mind and protecting others from similar harm. Be it from Mike & Tammy, or their own families, communities, or institutions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <hr />
  <p>I now live far away. I'm a mess. All the same, it feels amazing to prove to my heart, mind, and body that I'm
    finally safe. From them. From a world they control. From carrying their lies as my own. And from being harmed for
    speaking the truth.</p>
  <p>I don’t feel comfortable around other humans. I’ve got a safe place to stay. I run out of money very shortly.
    Bankrupting myself to support the necessary psychological restoration to make these statements was worth it.</p>
