Mike McOrmond and Tammy McOrmond</a> <small>(YouTube, Abuse Statement / Report,
27m15s)</small></h3>
<p>Text version available below (<a href="#abuse-statement-text">here</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, this is from Mikey McOrmond (Michael James McOrmond). I’m broadcasting the historical acts of my still living “parents” as widely as possible. I’ve finally had enough therapy, time, and space to recover memories of what they did to me, my siblings, and possibly other children.</p>
<p>I know as of a few years ago, Mike would sometimes spend 1:1 time with a neighbor’s kid across the street from their house. I’d text that family directly if I had their info. I don’t. I’m not a member of the Nextdoor app or relevant neighborhood community, either.</p>
<p>Now that I'm free from the emotional weight of initially ripping this band-aid off, I'm doing my best to wave a red flag for the community near their residence.</p>
<!-- <span>If you’re on this list, it’s because at some point in the last 17 years:</span>
<ul>
  <li>A. I felt ANY degree of emotional connection to you.</li>
  <li>B. You emailed me and ended up with your address in my gmail’s “Other Contacts”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you tried to use me, have me use you, or actually knew what
  love was: Thanks for having been a part of my life! 💗</p> -->
<hr />
<p>I now live far away. I'm a mess. All the same, it feels amazing to prove to my heart, mind, and body that I'm finally safe. From them. From a world they control. From carrying their lies as my own. And from being harmed for speaking the truth.</p>
<p>I don’t feel comfortable around other humans. I’ve got a safe place to stay. I run out of money very shortly. Bankrupting myself to support the necessary psychological restoration to make these statements was worth it.</p>

<h3>Growing Up in the House of Mike McOrmond and Tammy McOrmond</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>I'm choosing to face, process, and share the truth. A horrifying reality hidden inside decades of internalized lies, shame, and confusion.</li>
<li>I listened to Jeanette McCurdy’s book “I’m Glad My Mom Died” over the summer. (It's amazing.)</li>
<li>Now, for my own sake, I’m going to describe some of my experiences as a kid:</li>
<li>Having meals withheld when I failed to perform “instructed” (commanded) tasks within a specified timeframe. Particularly school or chore (work) tasks.</li>
<li>Having my head and hair buzzed off by Tammy, against my will, despite my visible distress and protests, while at least one (likely 2+) siblings watched and laughed.</li>
<li>Being spanked, on my bare butt, Mike rubbing my butt, statements like “I don’t like doing this to you”, and “it’s for your own good”, being left bruised afterwards, and these events usually happening while bent over Mike and Tammy's marital bed.</li>
<li>Being coerced into covert incest behaviors and beliefs, like:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Kissing Tammy on the lips to make Mike jealous (wtf).</li>
  <li>Emotionally caretaking Tammy and having to internalize / align my inner world into matching her resentment towards Mike.</li>
  <li>Confessing (turning myself in) to one or both of my parents when I had done anything sexual. Then being asked about such experiences with a disturbing level of specificity.</li>
  <li>Having to, in detail, describe some "erotic media" I had looked at while sitting on Mike and Tammy's marital bed with them. (The "evil" videos were great, btw.)</li>
  <li>Being forced to undergo “deliverance prayer” by my father and the lead pastor of the church we attended after mentioning to one of my sisters that my dream was to live in a shack in the woods. They told me I had “fear of failure”.</li>
  <li>Mike sitting down with me to discuss whether or not I’ve ever “had sexual urges toward the cat”.</li>
  <li>Learning about rape, violence, prostitution, incest (Noah), medieval torture methods (crucifixion, iron maiden, racking, circumcision, etc) at an age far too young to be appropriate.</li>
  <li>Tammy randomly forcing me to hang out who she chose. In one case, even manipulating another kid’s mother into forcing a one-off afternoon with he and I together. He was nice. Thanks bro.</li>
</ul>
<li>Being told “you’re no longer allowed to spend time with your friend” (a neighbor) for no reason, out of the blue, by Mike. Then being made to call her and tell her this myself, without being able communicate or even understand why this decision had been made for me.</li>
<li>Being autistic, ADHD (both learning disabilities) and never receiving help for either. Living in a constant state of anxiety, shame, and guilt for "all my failures”. Everything wrong being “my fault” and the result of “not trying hard enough” or "laziness".</li>
<li>Being (multiple times a week) forced to eat food that made me viscerally (literally) gag and / or nauseous. Not being allowed an alternative OR allowed to skip eating.</li>
<li>Being brainwashed into believing that being gay, trans, or that having sexual desires, even internally was wrong [shameful, sin, to be removed, to be fixed].</li>
<li>Taught to embody self-sacrifice and suffering as the meaning of life (a martyr complex). Taught to “forgive” by forgetting anything happened (enabling).</li>
<li>Being repeatedly told “you are not the center of the universe”, “you are NOT allowed to say ‘no’”, and other boundary compromising (annihilating) statements.</li>
<li>Mike being hypervigilant / on guard / hyper suspicious toward any vehicle or passersby near their residence for anything diverging from "perfectly normal".</li>
<li>Hearing Mike claim that "my kids are my retirement plan" disguised as a joke. This happened to me as an <i>adult</i>.</li>

<li>Being home-schooled for all 12 years of my education under the supposed justification that alternative options would teach "things we don't believe". All 7 of their children / my siblings were educated this way. (Turns out there's a <i>reason</i> my artistic expression as a teen featured a prison camp, shackles, dungeons, and other disturbing themes. HUH.)</li>
<li>And PILES of other (often far worse) things I witnessed but am presently leaving for my siblings to discuss / sort / air out for themselves.</li>
<li>Lastly, out of present concern for communities Mike and Tammy interact with TODAY:</li>
<li>Why did Mike choose to merge his church and family into one which, a decade later, I (and we, publicly) would find out had a convicted pedophile as one of its elders? For how long did Mike know that the church he chose to merge with had “internally handled” (read: buried and not escalated to appropriate authorities) at least one previous instance of child sexual abuse by the same man?</li>
</ul>
