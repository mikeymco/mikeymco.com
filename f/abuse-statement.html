  <div id="abuse-statement-text">
    <ul>
      <li>I'm choosing to face, process, and share the truth. A horrifying reality hidden inside decades of internalized lies, shame, and confusion.</li>
      <li>I listened to Jeanette McCurdy’s book “I’m Glad My Mom Died” over the summer. It's amazing. And, for my own sake, I’m now opening up about my experience of being abused by Mike and Tammy McOrmond.</li>
      <li>What follows is a list of moments and patterns. In isolation, overt examples of abuse and neglect. All-told and combined, a process of dehumanization, violation, indoctrination, and exploitation so <i>comprehensive</i> I can only bear to look at one small piece at a time. Physical, sexual, emotional, mental, and spiritual.</li>
      <!-- <li>A full-spectrum, assembly-line of trauma! A way to keep your child "yours", no matter what. When complete, the child will worship you as their god! Hell or high water, sickness or health. Whether you are present or absent. They will beg you to keep them safe. To have you let them "come home". Both to you, your house, and <i>before even feeling at home in their body</i>! They will beg you to protect them from the world, and even want protection from <i>themselves</i>. Lastly, and best of all, once the process is complete, your child will <i>remember nothing</i>. You will still, and forever, be the loving parents you always have been! Welcome to Your New Doll.</li> -->
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Here is how I was turned from a newborn baby, into a willing, <i>consenting</i>, and near-permanent, slave:</li>
      <li>Having meals withheld when I failed to perform “instructed” (commanded) tasks within a specified timeframe. Particularly school or chore (work) tasks.</li>
      <li>Having my head and hair buzzed off by Tammy, against my will, despite my visible distress and protests, while at least one (likely 2+) siblings watched and laughed.</li>
      <li>Being spanked, on my bare butt, Mike rubbing my butt, statements like “I don’t like doing this to you”, and “it’s for your own good”, being left bruised afterwards, and these events usually happening while bent over Mike and Tammy's <i>bed</i>.</li>
      <li>Being forced, coerced, and brainwashed into covert incest behaviors and beliefs, like:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Kissing Tammy on the lips to make Mike jealous.</li>
        <li>Having to emotionally caretake Tammy and having to internalize / align my inner world into matching her resentment towards Mike.</li>
        <li>Confessing (turning myself in) to Mike and / or Tammy when I had done, observed, or encountered anything sexual. Then being asked about such experiences with a disturbing and inappropriate level of depth. Example: Having to, in detail, describe "erotic media" I had looked at while sitting on Mike and Tammy's marital bed with them.</li>
        <li>Being forced to undergo “deliverance prayer” by Mike and the lead pastor of the church we attended after mentioning to one of my sisters that my dream was to live in a shack in the woods. They told me I had “fear of failure”. (I simply wanted to be somewhere I'd no longer be a "disappointment, burden, or bad kid". Read: The toxic family system's chosen scapegoat, emotional dumpster, and whipping boy.)</li>
        <li>Mike sitting down with me, out of the blue, to ask about and discuss whether "I’ve ever had sexual urges toward the cat”.</li>
        <li>Being taught, often in detail, about rape, violence, prostitution, incest (Noah), medieval torture methods (crucifixion, iron maiden, racking, circumcision, etc) at an age far too young to be appropriate. Both during at-home "bible" teaching sessions and during our church's (main service) sermons.</li>
        <li>Tammy randomly forcing me to hang out with who she chose. In one case, even manipulating another kid's mother into forcing a one-off, short-notice, afternoon he and I spent together. (He was nice. Thanks bro.)
        </li>
        <li>Being told "you're no longer allowed to spend time with your friend" (a neighbor) by Mike. Initially out of the blue, for no reason, then offered "I don't like you spending time alone with that girl". Then, being made to call her and tell her this myself without being able (allowed) to communicate or understand why this decision had been made for me.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Being autistic and ADHD (both learning disabilities), never receiving help for either, and being exploited, bullied, and shamed more than other family members for these traits. Abuse and isolation which resulted in me living in a constant state of anxiety, fear, and guilt for "all my failures”. Anything wrong could suddenly become “my fault”. Often, I'd be accused of and punished for “not trying hard enough” or "laziness".</li>
      <li>Multiple times a week, being forced to eat food that made me viscerally (literally) gag and / or nauseous. Not being allowed an alternative OR allowed to skip eating.</li>
      <li>Being brainwashed via:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Extreme, rigid, and arbitrary (read: child-specific, double-standardized, and moving target) rules and expectations.</li>
        <li>Control, censorship, and forceful "insertion" of information and ideas via pain, systemic (peer) pressure, and manipulation.</li>
        <li>Followed by physical, mental, and emotional retaliatory abuse [corporal punishment, public humiliation, system-wide shaming] should one not comply and align with whatever the defined "right" / "true" / "Christlike" perspective, attitude, or behavior was.</li>
        <li>Some topics in particular were so extremely taboo that any deviation or even <i>unintentional appearance of deviation</i> would result in a system-wide shitstorm, punishments, and removal / disposal / confiscation of relevant items. Followed by anywhere from days to weeks of aftermath abuse (usually shaming, guilting, or forcing of "reconciliatory" hoop-jumping until the relevant sadist was sufficiently satisfied).</li>
        <li>Having any thoughts, feelings, or expressing oneself in ANY way indicative of being gay, trans, having sexual desire, or embodying sexuality were forcefully and violently stomped out, censored, and removed.</li>
        <li>Being interested in, attracted to, desiring of, or <i>spending time with</i> the opposite sex was prohibited until:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Arbitrary, child-specific, age thresholds were passed.</li>
          <li>Coerced contractual obligations fulfilled ("a proper, respectful of the parents, 'dating for marriage' relationship process was followed", or purity contracts which involved signing ones body over to Mike or "divine authority" were used. A process where individuals "belong" to the father until appropriately handed over "to a new authority").</li>
          <li>Or other requirements met in order to secure "approval", like only being allowed to interact in group settings, if the parties were ones Mike or Tammy <i>liked</i>, interactions were monitored by authority figures, or extensive vetting had been completed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>This brainwashing was (and is) so effective, that <strong>even internal</strong> experiencing of any aspects of myself outside the acceptable beliefs became incredibly difficult to feel, enjoy, or express. I'm still suffering from this. To this day + despite years of therapy, I still experience heart palpitations and fear of violence from others if (when) I choose to express myself with any degree of femininity. Only through years of therapy, ERP, meds, tons of practice, and an indescribable amount of determination, have I managed to both make this statement and, in isolated moments, feel like my real self.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence (brainwashing, mind-control) to embody self-sacrifice and suffering as the meaning of life (aka: a martyr complex).</li>
      <li>Taught via force, conditioning, and violence (again, <i>real</i> brainwashing and mind-control) to “forgive” by forgetting anything happened (enabling). Except, this is only applied when convenient or pleasurable for the highest ranking narcissist in the room at any given time.</li>
      <li>Being repeatedly told “you are NOT allowed to say ‘no’”, “you are NOT allowed to express anger / sadness / protest (discomfort)”, and other boundary compromising (annihilating) statements.</li>
      <li>Mike being hypervigilant / on guard / hyper suspicious toward any vehicle or passersby near our residence. And any divergence from "perfectly normal" behavior by the outside world being reacted to with fear, preparatory defensiveness, and a creepy level of observation.</li>
      <li>Mike claiming, as a joke, that "my kids are my retirement plan". A statement I witnessed as an <i>adult</i>.</li>
      <li>Being home-schooled for all 12 years of my education, under the supposed justification that alternative options would teach "things we don't believe". All 7 of Mike & Tammy's children / my siblings were educated this way. (Oh, so there's a <i>reason</i> my artistic expression as a teen featured prison camps, shackles, dungeons, predatory facial expressions, burning alive, and other disturbing themes? HUH.)</li>
      <li>MANY other, often worse things, that:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A. I witnessed first-hand but have decided to leave for my siblings to discuss, bring justice to, or find closure for.</li>
        <li>B. Were <i>covered up</i> and buried, only to resurface years or decades later.</li>
        <li>C. I can't remember, or my memories are too fragmented to fully / reliably articulate.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Lastly, and out of present concern for communities that Mike and Tammy interact with <i>in the present</i>:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Why did Mike choose to merge his church and family into one which, a decade later, I (and we, publicly) would find out had a convicted pedophile as one of its elders? For how long did Mike know that the church he chose to merge with had “internally handled” (read: buried and not escalated to appropriate authorities) at least one prior instance of child sexual abuse by the <i>same man</i>?</li>
        <li>A red flag for the community near Mike and Tammy's residence: As of a few years ago, I know that Mike would sometimes spend 1:1 time with a neighbor kid living across the street. I'm unable to text that family, not on Nextdoor, or connected to any relevant neighborhood community. I did manage to text one neighbor. I hope that somehow, some-way, my statement reaches that family.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <p>Hi. Yes, this is Mikey (Michael James McOrmond). I’ve finally had enough therapy, time, and space to recover sufficient memories of what my "parents" did to me, my siblings, possibly other children. My body is physically, <i>viscerally</i> terrified to theorize, write, record, and post this. It's taking all I have to summon the internal autonomy to keep going anyway. I’m broadcasting these historical acts of abuse as widely as possible in hope of both further freeing my mind, and protecting others from similar harm. Be it from Mike & Tammy, or their own families, communities, or institutions using similar tactics.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>I'm ok. I'm a mess. I'm alive. Breathing. That's enough. I'm through the initial emotional struggle of ripping this band-aid off.</p>
  <p>I live far away from Rochester. I couldn't have done this were I still anywhere near.</p>
  <p>I don’t feel comfortable around other humans. I do have a safe place to stay (my car, which is the best home I've ever had).</p>
  <p>I'm still trying to prove to my heart, mind, and body that I'm safe. From Mike & Tammy. From a world they control. From carrying their lies as my own. And from being harmed for speaking the truth.</p>
  <p>Doing this felt, and feels, a lot like dying. It's taken me <i>years</i> to recall, admit, and understand my past this clearly. And I'm <i>still</i> actively recovering memories. Somewhat disappointingly, the new ones are usually more gross, not less.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>I run out of money very shortly. If bankrupting myself is the cost of psychological restoration sufficient to make these statements, cool. It was worth it.</p>
